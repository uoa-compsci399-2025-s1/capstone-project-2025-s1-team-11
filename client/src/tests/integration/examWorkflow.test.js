/* EXAMPLE STRUCTURE ONLY - INCOMPLETE

This test would verify a complete workflow that involves multiple Redux actions working together:

Create a new exam
Add sections to the exam
Add questions to the sections
Move a question between sections
Verify that question numbering updates correctly
Verify total marks calculation

This tests the integration between:

Exam creation functionality
Section management
Question management
Renumbering logic
Calculations based on the model structure
