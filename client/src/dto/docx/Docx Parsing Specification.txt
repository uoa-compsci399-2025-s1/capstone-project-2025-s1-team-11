Parsing Specification
Document Start Assumption
•	Unless explicit section break at start of doc, assume doc starts with a question
Question Detection (ANY of these = question start)
Detection Strategy: Scan for ANY indicator, prefer the most reliable when multiple present:
1.	Double paragraph break (most reliable structural indicator)
•	Two consecutive paragraph breaks (unless at document end)
2.	Bookmark (explicit Word marker)
•	Word bookmark indicates question start
3.	Marks tag (content-based, most flexible)
•	^\[\s*(\d*(?:\.\d+)?)\s*m?\s*a?\s*r?\s*k?\s*s?\s*\] - handles [ # mark(s) ] ignoring spaces and plural 's'
Redundancy Handling: If multiple indicators present (e.g., double break → bookmark → marks tag), treat as ONE question with the indicators in sequence.
Question Body Detection
•	Start: After question start detection, after [# marks] tag (if present), after "Question #" (if present)
•	End: At next paragraph break (not part of table) OR at table start
•	Table handling: Drop table + warning, continue as if table didn't exist
Answer Detection
•	Answer start: Paragraph break after question body (non-table)
•	Answer end: Next paragraph break (non-table)
•	Question termination:
1.	Empty paragraph after ≥1 answer
2.	New question start indicator detected
3.	Section break detected
4.	End of document
Section Detection
Primary: Explicit section break (XML w:sectPr) - questions after open/before close are nestedAlternative: Standalone paragraph section detection
•	If NOT in section AND paragraph occurs between two hard returns AND no single paragraph breaks with following text (which would indicate question/answer pattern)
•	→ Interpret as section body with no nested questions
Section Body Detection
•	Text after section break = section body content
•	Section body ends when: bookmark OR marks tag OR double paragraph break detected
•	Table handling: Drop tables in section body + warning
Table Handling (Universal)
•	Detection: Look for table patterns (cells, rows) and XML table elements
•	Action: Drop table including paragraph break at start + generate warning
•	Continuation: Parse after table as if table didn't exist (don't treat as paragraph break)
Enhanced Error Handling
Warnings for:
•	Tables detected and dropped (with location info)
•	Malformed marks tags (but still parsed)
•	Inconsistent answer counts across questions
•	Empty sections
•	Ambiguous content patterns
Graceful Degradation:
•	Malformed marks → extract what's possible, default to 1
•	Multiple question indicators → use most reliable
•	Ambiguous content → prefer question interpretation
