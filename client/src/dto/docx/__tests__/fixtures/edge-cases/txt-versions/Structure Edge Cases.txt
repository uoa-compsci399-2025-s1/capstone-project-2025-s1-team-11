This might have been intended as the 7th question - but since no double hard-returns, marks tag or bookmark have been placed between the start of this text and the section break before it, it should be interpreted as a section body.

[1 mark] Question 10. Two section breaks were inserted before this question with nothing in between. That would imply a completely empty section. That should import as an empty section with no nested questions. Ideally the user should be notified of the empty section but this is not necessary. This question should be un-nested.
