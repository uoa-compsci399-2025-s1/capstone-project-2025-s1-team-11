                Assessly is designed to be a lightweight, streamlined, user-friendly web application platform developed to create an efficient process for creating, marking, and analysing multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination papers.
                The idea behind Assessly was born from challenges faced by academic staff at the University of Auckland, and the development of this project was designed with accessibility and ease of use in mind, especially for those without technical backgrounds. 
                Through this application, staff can spend less time on tedious formatting and manual workflow, instead leaving more time for teaching and improving assessment quality.
