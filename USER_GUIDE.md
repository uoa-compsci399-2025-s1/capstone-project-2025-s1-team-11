# Welcome to Assessly! üëã

## What is Assessly?
Assessly is your new exam management system that makes creating and managing exams simple and straightforward. Think of it as a digital workspace where you can:
- Create new exams from scratch
- Import existing exams
- Edit and organize exam content
- Save your work automatically
- Export exams in different formats

## Let's Get Started! üöÄ

### First Things First
Before we begin, we need to set up a few things on your computer. Don't worry - we'll guide you through each step!

1. **Install Google Chrome** (if you don't have it already)
   - Go to [Google Chrome Website](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
   - Click the big blue "Download Chrome" button
   - Follow the installation prompts
   - This is important because Assessly works best with Chrome

2. **Install Node.js**
   - Visit [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Click the big green "LTS" button to download
   - Run the installer
   - Click "Next" through the installation steps
   - This helps run Assessly on your computer

3. **Install Python**
   - Go to [Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Click the big yellow "Download Python" button
   - **Important**: When you run the installer, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"
   - This helps Assessly work with some special features

### Setting Up Assessly

#### Step 1: Get the Application
1. Look for the green "Code" button at the top of this page
2. Click it and select "Download ZIP"
3. Find the downloaded ZIP file (usually in your Downloads folder)
4. Right-click the ZIP file and select "Extract All"
5. Choose a location to save it (like your Documents folder)

#### Step 2: Set Up the Application
1. Inside the extracted folder, find and open the `client` folder
2. Hold the Shift key and right-click in the empty space

4. Copy and paste these commands one at a time (press Enter after each):
   ```

   ```
   (This might take a few minutes - that's normal!)
