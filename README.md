## Background

Assessly is an examination builder, randomiser, marking suite, and statistics platform. Out of the box, Assessly generates four distinct versions of a provided MCQ exam accepting inputs from Docx, Moodle XML, and LATEX. Assesly shuffles the multiple-choice answer options creating unique marking scripts for each version. 

Assessly is a Front-End Heavy, Client-Side Rendering application, meaning, very little work is done by the server. A flask server is being used solely for interoperability with existing services managed by the University of Auckland's Computer Science department, this could be replaced by a CDN or static site server, or another framework if needed. For development, you can either use this service with the Flask server-side backend or without it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In order to install and use Assessly, you will need to install:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Chromium Based Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser))

### Installation

#### 1. Client-side 
1. Navigate to client directory ```cd client```
2. Install npm prerequisites ```npm install```

#### 2. Server-side (optional)
5. Navigate to client directory ```cd ../server```
6. Open the backend folder and create a venv ```cd <path>/backend``` ```python -m venv /.venv```
7. Still in the backend folder, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Running the Development Environment

#### Option 1. Clientside development environment (recommended)
1. Start the clientside development environment using ```npm run dev```

#### Option 2. Serverside development environment
1. Start the server using ```cd <path>/backend``` and running ```python app.py```
2. Run ```npm run build``` to create a distributable - you can run this anytime you want to update what the server is sending.
